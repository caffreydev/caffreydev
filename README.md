### Hi there, welcome to Joe McCaffrey's githubðŸ‘‹
Innovative software engineer with a strong foundation in C#, .NET Core, and JavaScript, with a year of agency experience and prior to this a bootcamp background as a career changer from corporate finance.
I primarily build and ship backend code for websites running on content management systems such as Optimizely CMS 12 for large organisations.

Currently working as a server side engineer at MMT Digital.

Love to code and passionate about tech, often learning and working on projects outside of work, and enjoy competitive coding Katas (feel free to see my [Code Wars Profile!](https://www.codewars.com/users/caffreydev))
