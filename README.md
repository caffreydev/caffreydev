### Hi there, welcome to Joe McCaffrey's githubðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on a 13 week software engineering bootcamp with Northcoders, focused on full stack web development with Node JS backend and React front end, as well as a host of other technologies, languages, and frameworks - like SQL (Postgres), Express, Jest, and various others.

<br>

Check out https://nc-news-jm.onrender.com/api for a hosted back end API and SQL demonstration piece I have recently been working on, which will support a front end react project coming in a couple weeks (watch this space for the link).  Full summary of endpoints and methods on that path.

<br>

I also have experience with Python, including through a computer science and physical modelling module during a Physics degree at the University of Bristol, and more recently developed further through other courses I have pursued - including Harvard's David Malan's excellent CS50X.  
This also has given me a grounding in working with C, which I'd recommend to anyone as a great language both to write fast, performant code and as a learning experience in really getting closer to the fundamentals of programming.

<br>

A personal side project I'm working on is learning Unity game development with C#.  This builds on my C experience, experience with the mathematics of vector physics and forces, and skill of problem solving with high quality code.  I'm having a lot of fun seeing the code I write and projects I build come alive, and it is a great playground to practice and develop these core programming skills.

<br>

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating! 

<br>

Open to hearing about employment opportunities from dynamic companies doing great work in the software and technology space.
